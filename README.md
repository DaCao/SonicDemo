# SonicDemo

SonicDemo is a toy demo for the Philly Game Lab's "Sonic" 3D-Audio library. This is a good starting point for developing other demo apps, but since it contains the Sonic library github repo it is meant strictly for use internal to the PGL. To use SonicDemo as a starting point for your own demo or testing app, just fork it.
