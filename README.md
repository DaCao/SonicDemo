# SonicDemo

SonicDemo is a toy iOS demo for the [Philadelphia Game Lab](http://www.philadelphiagamelab.org)'s open source 3D Audio library, [Sonic](https://github.com/philadelphiagamelab/Sonic). This is a good starting point for developing other iOS apps with Sonic, but if you'd rather start from scratch you can follow the [Sonic setup instructions](https://github.com/PhiladelphiaGameLab/Sonic/blob/master/SETUP.md). To use SonicDemo as a starting point for your own demo or testing app, just fork or clone it.
